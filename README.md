![Data Architecture](docs/Data_Architecture.png)

### 1. Data Acquisition & Preparation
- **ETL Process**: Extracted patient visit data from healthcare system exports
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardized formats, handled missing values, removed duplicates
- **Data Enrichment**: Created calculated fields for enhanced analysis
- **Dimensional Modeling**: Implemented calendar dimensions for time intelligence

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Temporal Patterns**: Identified high-volume periods by day/hour
- **Demographic Correlations**: Analyzed satisfaction scores across demographic segments
- **Department Efficiency**: Measured wait times by referring department
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flagged unusual patterns in patient flow

### 3. Interactive Dashboard Development
- **Multi-page Layout**: Dashboard view for executives, detailed view for analysts
- **Interactive Elements**: Dynamic slicers, filters, and drill-through functionality
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Organized metrics by importance and relationship
- **Conditional Formatting**: Applied visual cues for performance indicators

### 4. Insight Development
- **Trend Identification**: Tracked patterns in patient volume and satisfaction
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compared wait times across departments
- **Demographic Impact Analysis**: Evaluated experience across patient segments
- **Resource Optimization Opportunities**: Highlighted peak demand periods

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques
